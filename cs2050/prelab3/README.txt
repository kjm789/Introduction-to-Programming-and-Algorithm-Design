Here is one solution to the prelab I gave you all. You'll notice that I do almost no error checking; you should be error checking. I also have included some commented out printf calls that I used for testing things as I wrote the solution. I encourage you to play around with this solution (commenting out function calls and uncommenting printfs) to see exactly what is going on. If you read closely you can also discern the order in which I wrote and tested the functions. I encourage you to do likewise; writing the entire solution and compiling when you are "done" is what leads to incomplete labs. Syntax and logic errors are MUCH easier to find with this "incrmental" development style. 
I included my entire netbeans project for your convienience, but the "meat" of the solution is in main.c.
