# Introduction-to-Programming-and-Algorithm-Design
A repository of examples in C for use as a reference. 

I am currently a TA for CS1050 at University of Missouri - Columbia. This repository holds some examples of coding projects that I have made for my students. They are shared freely in the hope that they can aid others in learning the C language and programming in general, but no guarantee is made of any kind. Particularly, the solutions offered here are not even necessarily the best solution for the problem presented. There are times when I intentionally do something not the "best" way as to prevent overloading the students with concepts they have not learned yet.
